# Deck-OF-CARDS
This code creates a Card class with two data members, rank and suit, and a Deck class with a vector of Cards.
The Deck class has a constructor that initializes the deck with all 52 cards, a shuffle method that shuffles the cards randomly, and a draw method that returns the top card from the deck and removes it from the vector.
The main function creates a Deck object, shuffles the cards, and deals the cards to two players, each represented by a vector of Cards. 
The program then prints out the hands for testing purposes.
